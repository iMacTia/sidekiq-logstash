[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sidekiq-logstash.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sidekiq-logstash) [<img src="https://travis-ci.org/iMacTia/sidekiq-logstash.svg?branch=master" alt="version" />](https://travis-ci.org/iMacTia/sidekiq-logstash)


Sidekiq::Logstash turns your [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) log into an organised, aggregated, JSON-syntax log ready to be sent to a logstash server.

```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-logstash'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install sidekiq-logstash
```

## Usage

Simply add the following to your sidekiq configuration (in Rails, this will be `initializers/sidekiq.rb`)

```ruby
Sidekiq::Logstash.setup
```

I suggest you add it on top of it, before any other `Sidekiq.configure_server` initialization, in order to avoid unformatted logging.

## Configuration

Sidekiq::Logstash allows you to provide custom configuration

```ruby
Sidekiq::Logstash.configure do |config|
  # filter_args will allow you to filter the job arguments removing
  # it works just like rails params filtering (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#parameters-filtering)
  config.filter_args << 'foo'
  
  # by default, the "job started" logs are omitted from the logs
  # to have one-line logs for each log (following Lograge), but you can
  # enable job start logs by setting the following flag:
  config.job_start_log = true
  
  # custom_option is a Proc that will be called before logging the payload, allowing you to add fields to it
  config.custom_options = lambda do |payload|
    payload['my_custom_field'] = 'my_custom_value'
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
